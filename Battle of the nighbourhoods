Problem and Background

Vancouver is one of the most popular cities in Canada. It is the third most populated city in Canada and is also one of its most diverse in terms of ethnicity. 
It is also acknowledged to be the most well-lived city in the world by the 'Economist Intelligence Unit'. 
I would like to find out the reason why someone should open a restaurant in Vancouver compared to a city like New York and what benefits opening a restaurant would bring to the them there. 

Data

For the data I will be using the census local area profiles from the census local area profiles 2016, which provided statistics about various areas that may be of use for the person opening up the restaurant in Vancouver.
