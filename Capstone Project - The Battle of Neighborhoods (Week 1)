Problem and Background

Vancouver is one of the most popular cities in Canada. It is the third most populated city in Canada and is also one of its most diverse in terms of ethnicity. 
It is also acknowledged to be the most well-lived city in the world by the 'Economist Intelligence Unit'. 
I would like to find out the reason why someone should open a restaurant in Vancouver and what benefits opening a restaurant would bring to the them.
